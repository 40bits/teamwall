# Demo

The demo is a kind of quick starter. It shows you the possible instruments in action after you set up the demo.

# Set up #

- Copy `teamwall.json` and the `data` directory into your project directory (the one which contains server.js).
- Run your server (e.g. node server.js) and visit `http:localhost:8888`
